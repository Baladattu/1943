Hereâ€™s a concise version of the `README.md` file for your QR code food calorie scanner app:

```markdown
# QR Code Food Calorie Scanner

A simple React application that uses the device camera to scan QR codes containing food item information. Once scanned, the app calculates and displays the total calories of the food items based on predefined calorie values.

## How It Works

- The user scans a QR code using the device's camera.
- The QR code contains JSON data about food items (e.g., name and quantity).
- The app calculates the calories for each item using predefined values and displays the result.
- The camera automatically closes after a successful scan.

## Example QR Code Data

The app expects QR codes to contain data in the following format:

```json
{
  "dishName": "South Indian Breakfast",
  "items": [
    { "name": "Idli", "quantity": 2 },
    { "name": "Sambhar", "quantity": 1 },
    { "name": "Chutney", "quantity": 1 }
  ]
}
```

For this QR code, the app will display the total calories for each item based on the quantity.

## Technologies Used
